#Proctoring System for Online Examinations
Overview
This project aims to develop a computer vision-enabled and AI-powered proctoring system designed to assist human proctors in various types of online examinations. The system utilizes multimedia streams, including video and audio from the user, along with system variables as input data. Relevant information is extracted and processed by an algorithm to calculate the probability of the user engaging in malpractices during the examination.

Objectives
To achieve the project's aim, the following objectives have been identified:

1. Efficient Cheating Behavior Identification: Develop a proctoring system capable of efficiently identifying cheating behavior during online examinations.
2. Accurate Malpractice Detection: Create an algorithm that accurately detects malpractices, ensuring the integrity of online assessments.
3. Resource Efficiency: Design the system to consume fewer computational resources, making it feasible for widespread adoption.
4. User-Friendly Interface: Develop a user-friendly interface for both proctors and examinees, ensuring ease of use and a seamless examination experience.
